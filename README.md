# Memory Game üÉè

This game is a sample application replicating what the game of [Concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)) for Android devices. This has been made as part of [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)'s Coding Challenge for Winter 2020 internships. The goal here is to represent a regular game without too much fluff mostly due to time constraints. üòÖ
