# Utsuru Concept ðŸ“·

This application is used for a photo repository as per [Shopify]([https://www.shopify.com/](https://www.shopify.com/)'s backend [coding challenge]([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKRywXQLZWOqVOHC4JkF3LqdpO3Llpfk_CkZPR8bjak/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKRywXQLZWOqVOHC4JkF3LqdpO3Llpfk_CkZPR8bjak/edit)) for Winter 2020 internships.

## Why Utsuru Concept?

Utsuru comes from the Japanese word **æ˜ ã‚‹** which means "to reflect/to project". In that sense, this service would be used for saving various reflections in the form of photography. 

Concept means that it is a proof-of-concept and that it may or may not be used for future usage.
